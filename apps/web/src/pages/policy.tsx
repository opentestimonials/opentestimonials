          <li>The deletion of the Personal Information we have about them</li>
          <li>

            To know specific pieces of Personal Information we have about them
          </li>
        </ul>

          treatment if they exercise the rights list above.

            Requests for Deletion and to Know About Information Collected
          </strong>
        </h4>
        <p>
          If you make a request for deletion of Personal Information or a
          request to know about Personal Information we have collected, we may
          require that you provide information and follow procedures so that we
          can verify the request and your jurisdiction before responding to it.
          The verification steps we take may differ depending on the request you
          make. We will match the information that you provide in your request
          to information we already have on file to verify your identity. If we
          are able to verify your request, we will process it. If we cannot
          verify your request, we may ask you for additional information to help
          us verify your request.
        </p>
        <p>
          California residents will be required to submit their first and last
          name and email address and may also be asked to provide their
          telephone number or address so that we can verify the request. Please
          provide as much of the requested information as possible to help us
          verify the request. We will only use the information received in a
          request for the purposes of responding to the request.
        </p>
        <p>
          California law permits California residents to use an authorized agent
          to make privacy rights requests. We require the authorized agent to
          provide proof of the California resident’s written permission (for
          example, a power of attorney) that shows the authorized agent has the
          authority to submit a request for the California resident. An
          authorized agent must follow the process described below to make a
          request. We will additionally require the authorized agent to verify
          his/her own identity.
        </p>
        <p>You may submit a request to us by:</p>
