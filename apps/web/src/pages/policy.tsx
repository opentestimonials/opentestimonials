          Visit the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) Opt-Out Page
          (http://www.aboutads.info/choices). The DAA Opt-Out Page provides a

          Additionally, many network advertising programs allow you to view and

          types of personalized advertisements you may receive.

        Please note that even if you choose to remove your information or “opt

        <strong>California Privacy Rights</strong>
      </h3>
      <p>
        Under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), California
        residents have the right to request:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The deletion of the Personal Information we have about them</li>
        <li>
          To know additional information about whether and how we have
          collected, used, and disclosed Personal Information about them
        </li>
        <li>
          To know specific pieces of Personal Information we have about them
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        California residents also have the right not to receive discriminatory
        treatment if they exercise the rights list above.
      </p>
      <h4>
        <strong>
          Requests for Deletion and to Know About Information Collected
        </strong>
      </h4>
      <p>
        If you make a request for deletion of Personal Information or a request
        to know about Personal Information we have collected, we may require
        that you provide information and follow procedures so that we can verify
        the request and your jurisdiction before responding to it. The
        verification steps we take may differ depending on the request you make.
        We will match the information that you provide in your request to
        information we already have on file to verify your identity. If we are
        able to verify your request, we will process it. If we cannot verify
        your request, we may ask you for additional information to help us
        verify your request.
      </p>
      <p>
        California residents will be required to submit their first and last
        name and email address and may also be asked to provide their telephone
        number or address so that we can verify the request. Please provide as
        much of the requested information as possible to help us verify the
        request. We will only use the information received in a request for the
        purposes of responding to the request.
      </p>
      <p>
        California law permits California residents to use an authorized agent
        to make privacy rights requests. We require the authorized agent to
        provide proof of the California resident’s written permission (for
        example, a power of attorney) that shows the authorized agent has the
        authority to submit a request for the California resident. An authorized
        agent must follow the process described below to make a request. We will
        additionally require the authorized agent to verify his/her own
        identity.
      </p>
      <p>You may submit a request to us by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Emailing us at privacyrequest@opentestimonials.com</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>
        <strong>Other California Requirements</strong>
