          and you authorize us (or our third-party payment processor) to charge
          your payment method for the corresponding amount.

          <strong>
            Open Testimonials and the other Open Testimonials Parties will not
            be liable to you under any theory of liability—whether based in

            permitted by the applicable law, even if Open Testimonials or the
            other Open Testimonials Parties have been advised of the possibility
            of such damages. The limitations of liability set for in this
            section will apply even if the remedies otherwise provided under

        <p>
          <strong>
            The total liability of Open Testimonials and the other Open

            PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU
            TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS WITH INSTACOACH AND LIMITS
            THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.
          </strong>
        </p>
        <h4>19.1. Binding Arbitration</h4>
        <p>
          Except for any disputes, claims, suits, actions, causes of action,
          demands, or proceedings (collectively, “Disputes”) arising out of or
          related to a violation of Sections 10 or 12 or Disputes in which
          either party seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court
          or seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful
          use of intellectual property, including, without limitation,
          copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, or patents,
          you and Open Testimonials agree (a) to waive your and Open
          Testimonials’s respective rights to have any and all Disputes arising
          from or related to these Terms, our Services, or the products and
          services available on our Services, resolved in a court, and (b) to
          waive your and Open Testimonials’s respective rights to a jury trial.
          Instead, you and Open Testimonials agree to arbitrate Disputes through
          binding arbitration (which is the referral of a Dispute to one or more
          persons charged with reviewing the Dispute and making a final and
          binding determination to resolve it instead of having the Dispute
          decided by a judge or jury in court).
        </p>
        <h4>
          19.2. No Class Arbitrations, Class Actions or Representative Actions
        </h4>
        <p>
          You and Open Testimonials agree that any Dispute arising out of or
          related to these Terms, our Services, or the products and services
          available on our Services is personal to you and Open Testimonials and
          that such Dispute will be resolved solely through individual
          arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class
          action, or any other type of representative proceeding. You and Open
          Testimonials agree that there will be no class arbitration or
          arbitration in which an individual attempts to resolve a Dispute as a
          representative of another individual or group of individuals. Further,
          you and Open Testimonials agree that a Dispute cannot be brought as a
          class or other type of representative action, whether within or
          outside of arbitration, or on behalf of any other individual or group
          of individuals
        </p>
        <h4>19.3. Federal Arbitration Act</h4>
        <p>
          You and Open Testimonials agree that these Terms affect interstate
          commerce and that the enforceability of this Section 19 will be both
          substantively and procedurally governed by and construed and enforced
          in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.
          (the “<strong>FAA</strong>”), to the maximum extent permitted by
          applicable law.
        </p>
        <h4>19.4. Notice; Informal Dispute Resolution</h4>
        <p>
          You and Open Testimonials agree that each party will notify the other
          party in writing of any arbitrable or small claims Dispute within
          thirty (30) days of the date it arises, so that the parties can
          attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute informally. Notice to
          Open Testimonials will be sent by certified mail or courier to
          [Delaware]. Your notice must include (a) your name, postal address,
          telephone number, the email address you use or used for your Open
          Testimonials account, and, if different, an email address at which you
          can be contacted, (b) a description in reasonable detail of the nature
          or basis of the Dispute, and (c) the specific relief that you are
          seeking. Our notice to you will be sent electronically and will
          include (x) our name, postal address, telephone number, and an email
          address at which we can be contacted with respect to the Dispute, (y)
          a description in reasonable detail of the nature or basis of the
          Dispute, and (z) the specific relief that we are seeking. If you and
          Open Testimonials cannot agree how to resolve the Dispute within
          thirty (30) days after the date notice is received by the applicable
          party, then either you or Open Testimonials may, as appropriate and in
          accordance with this Section 19, commence an arbitration proceeding
          or, to the extent specifically provided for in Section 19.1, file a
          claim in court.
        </p>
        <h4>19.5. Process</h4>
        <p>
          Except for Disputes arising out of or related to a violation of
          Sections 10 or 12 or Disputes in which either party seeks to bring an
          individual action in small claims court or seeks injunctive or other
          equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual
          property, including, without limitation, copyrights, trademarks, trade
          names, logos, trade secrets, or patents, you and Open Testimonials
          agree that any Dispute must be commenced or filed by you or Open
          Testimonials within one (1) year of the date the Dispute arose,
          otherwise the underlying claim is permanently barred (which means that
          you and Open Testimonials will no longer have the right to assert such
          claim regarding the Dispute). You and Open Testimonials agree that (a)
          any arbitration will occur in Redwood City, California, (b)
          arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in
          accordance with the rules of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation
          Services (“JAMS”), which are hereby incorporated by reference, and (c)
          that the state or federal courts of the State of California and the
          United States, respectively, sitting in Redwood City, California, have
          exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an
          arbitration award. You may also litigate a Dispute in the small claims
          court located in the county of your billing address if the Dispute
          meets the requirements to be heard in small claims court.
        </p>
        <h4>19.6. Authority of Arbitrator</h4>
        <p>
          As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the applicable JAMS rules, the
          arbitrator will have (a) the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to
          make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding a Dispute,
          including the determination of whether a Dispute is arbitrable, and
          (b) the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be
          available in court; provided, however, that the arbitrator does not
          have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative
          action, which is prohibited by these Terms. The arbitrator may only
          conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than
          one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or
          representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving
          more than one individual.
        </p>
        <h4>19.7. Rules of JAMS</h4>
        <p>
          The rules of JAMS and additional information about JAMS are available
          on the&nbsp; <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/">JAMS website</a>. By
          agreeing to be bound by these Terms, you either (a) acknowledge and
          agree that you have read and understand the rules of JAMS, or (b)
          waive your opportunity to read the rules of JAMS and any claim that
          the rules of JAMS are unfair or should not apply for any reason.
        </p>
        <h4>19.8. Severability</h4>
        <p>
          If any term, clause or provision of this Section 19 is held invalid or
          unenforceable, it will be so held to the minimum extent required by
          law, and all other terms, clauses and provisions of this Section 19
          will remain valid and enforceable. Further, the waivers set forth in
          Section 19.2 are severable from the other provisions of these Terms
          and will remain valid and enforceable, except as prohibited by
          applicable law.
        </p>
        <h4>19.9 Opt-Out Right</h4>
        <p>
          You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within thirty
          (30) days of the date you first accepted the terms of this Section 19
          by writing to: [ADDRESS]. In order to be effective, the opt out notice
          must include your full name and clearly indicate your intent to opt
          out of binding arbitration. By opting out of binding arbitration, you
          are agreeing to resolve Disputes in accordance with Section 20.
        </p>
        <h4>20. Applicable Law and Venue</h4>
        <p>
          These Terms and your use of our Services will be governed by and
          construed in accordance with the laws of California, without resort to
          its conflict of law provisions. To the extent the arbitration
          provision in Section 19 does not apply, you agree that any action at
          law or in equity arising out of or relating to these Terms will be
          filed only in the state and federal courts located in San Francisco,
          California and you hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consent and
          submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts over any suit,
          action, or proceeding arising out of these Terms.
        </p>
        <h4>21. Termination</h4>
        <p>
          Open Testimonials reserves the right, without notice and in its sole
          discretion, to terminate your license to access and use our Services
          and to block or prevent your future access to and use of our Services.

        <h4>22. Changes to These Terms</h4>
        <p>
          We may make changes to these Terms from time to time. If we make
          changes, we will post the amended Terms to our Services and update the
          “Last Updated” date above. We may also attempt to notify you by
          sending an email notification to the address associated with your
          account or providing notice through our Services. Unless we say
          otherwise in our notice, the amended Terms will be effective
          immediately and your continued access to and use of our Services after
          we provide notice will confirm your acceptance of the changes. If you
          do not agree to the amended Terms, you must stop accessing and using
          our Services.
        </p>
        <h4>23. Severability</h4>
        <p>
          If any provision of these Terms will be deemed unlawful, void, or
          unenforceable, then that provision will be deemed severable from these
          Terms and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any
          remaining provisions.
        </p>
